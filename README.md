#DC Life Hacks
The goal of this project is to compile a list "life hacks" (city hacks?) that residents and visitors of Washington, DC can use to make their experience here even better.  From tips on navigating city services to little known, hyper local facts about your favorite neighborhood.  

This is still very much a work in progress.   Please feel free to contribute!
