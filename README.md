#DC Life Hacks
My goal for this project is to compile a list "life hacks" (city hacks?) that residents and visitors of Washington, DC can use to make their experience here even better.  From tips on navigating city services to little known, hyper local facts about your favorite neighborhood.  This is still very much a work in progress.  If you happen to stumble across this project, please feel free to contribute your best DC life hacks!
